                <p>book is a set of printed sheets of paper held together between two covers. The sheets of paper are
                    usually covered with
                    a text, language and illustrations. The book is a more flexible format than the earlier idea of the
                    scroll. The change
                    from scrolls to books began in the Roman Empire, and took many centuries to become complete.

                    A writer of a book is called an author. Someone who draws pictures in a book is called an
                    illustrator. Books can have more than one author or illustrator.

                    A book can also be a text in a larger collection of texts. That way a book is perhaps written by one
                    author, or it only treats one subject area. Books in this sense can often be understood without
                    knowing the whole collection. Examples are the Iliad, Odyssey, Bible and Torah. All of them consist
                    of a number of “books” in this sense of the word. Encyclopedias often have separate articles written
                    by different people, and published as separate volumes. Each volume is a book.

                    Hardcover books have hard covers made of cardboard covered in cloth or leather and are usually sewn
                    together. Paperback books have covers of stiff paper and are usually glued together. The words in
                    books can be read aloud and recorded on tapes or compact discs. These are called "audiobooks".

                    Books can be borrowed from a library or bought from a bookstore. People can make their own books and
                    fill them with family photos, drawings, or their own writing. Some books are empty inside, like a
                    diary, address book, or photo album. Most of the time, the word "book" means that the pages inside
                    have words printed or written on them.

                    Some books are written just for children, or for entertainment, while other books are for studying

                    A common type of manuscript was the scroll, which was a long sheet rolled up. The sheet could have
                    been made of papyrus
                    (made by the Egyptians, by weaving the inner stems of the papyrus plant and then hammering them
                    together), or parchment
                    or vellum (very thin animal skin, first used by the ancient Greeks), or paper (made from plant
                    fibers, invented by the
                    Chinese). Manuscripts of this kind lasted to the 16th century and beyond. Turning the manuscript
                    into a book required
                    several developments.

                    The codex
                    The Romans were the first people to put separate pieces of manuscript between covers, to form a
                    codex. This was more
                    convenient to handle and store than scrolls, but was not yet a book as we understand it.

                    Printing
                    Scrolls and codices were written and copied by hand. The Chinese invented woodblock printing, where
                    shapes are carved
                    out of a block of wood, then ink is applied to the carved side, and the block is pressed onto paper.
                    This woodcut method
                    was slow because the symbols and pictures were made by cutting away the surrounding wood.

                    Johannes Gutenberg was the first to invent a machine for printing, the printing press, in the 15th
                    century. This
                    involved more than just a press, it involved the production of movable metal type suitable for the
                    machine process.
                    <hr>s<br>
                    Initially, the machines were slow, and needed a printer's muscle to make them work. The Industrial
                    Revolution brought
                    steam power and later electrification.[1][2][3]
                    A book can also be a text in a larger collection of texts. That way a book is perhaps written by one
                    author, or it only treats one subject area. Books in this sense can often be understood without
                    knowing the whole collection. Examples are the Iliad, Odyssey, Bible and Torah. All of them consist

                    <hr>aper and ink
                    Paper had been invented in China in the 8th century, but it was kept secret for a long time. In
                    Europe hand-made paper
                    was available from about 1450. It was cheaper than parchment but still expensive, and the earlys<br>
                    printing was a slow
                    process. Therefore, books remained rare. In 1800 the first machines for making paper from wood pulp
                    were invented. New
                    kinds of inks were also invented for various purposes, and machines were driven by steam engines and
                    later by
                    electricity.[4]<br>

                    The common cheap supply of paper fed the faster printing machines, and books became cheaper. At the
                    same time, in
                    America, Britain and continental Europe, more people learnt to read. So, in the 19th century, many
                    ordinary people could
                    afford to buy books and could actually read them. Also in the 19th century came public libraries, so
                    poorer people could
                    get access to the best books.[5]
                    s<br>
                    Binding
                    Printing was done on large sheets of paper, which were then folded, guillotined (cut) and sewn into
                    the covers.
                    Bookbinding and all the other processes have been done by machines since the 19th century.

                    Now
                    Today some of the technologies have been changed, especially those involving illustration ands<br>
                    typography. However, books
                    look much the same as they did, with more illustration in color, but basically the same. That is
                    because experience has
                    shown that readers need certain things for pleasurable reading. Graphic design and typography are
                    the practical arts
                    used to make books attractive and useful to readers.

                    <hr>

                    While reading, we have to remember different characters and settings that belong to a given story.
                    Even if you enjoy
                    reading a book in one sitting, you have to remember the details throughout the time you take to
                    read<br>
                    the book.
                    Therefore, reading is a workout for your brain that improves memory function.

                    We can all agree that reading cannot happen without focus and in order to fully understand the
                    story, we have to
                    concentrate on each page that we read. In a world where gadgets are only getting faster and<br>
                    shortening our attention
                    span, we need to constantly practice concentration and focus. Reading is one of the few activities
                    that requires your
                    undivided attention, therefore, improving your ability to concentrate.
