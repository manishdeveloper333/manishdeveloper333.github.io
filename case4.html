                <p>In Pressbooks, the Book Info page is where you put information about your book. In the book
                    publishing industry, this is
                    called “metadata”. Metadata allows book stores and libraries to accurately categorize a book and
                    makes it easier for
                    readers to find by answering questions like: What is this book’s title? Who is the author? When was
                    it published? and
                    What is the book about?<br>Copyright
                    A copyright notice is required for all books. By default, Pressbooks sets the copyright license
                    for<br>

                    all new books to All
                    Rights Reserved, and generates a default copyright notice for all book formats which includes your
                    book’s title, the<br>

                    author’s name and the book’s copyright license.

                    You can improve the automatic copyright notice by adding the name of the copyright holder and
                    specifying your desired
                    copyright license (including Creative Commons (CC) licenses, which allow copyright holders to grant
                    others free
                    permissions to use their work in various ways).

                    You can also create a custom copyright notice that overrides the default notice created by<br>

                    Pressbooks. Any content
                    entered into Copyright Notice section will override the automatically generated statement when an
                    All Rights Reserved
                    license is chosen, or be added to the generated statement when another license is chosen.

                    About the Book<br>

                    Book Tagline: This is a very short, one-line sentence that explains why someone should read your

                    beneath the title and

                    in<br>

                    the Pressbooks
                    Directory if no long description is present.

                    Long Description: A longer paragraph about your book that can also include reviews, praise, blurbs,
                    etc. The long will

                    benefits of reading
                    are aside from<br>
                    <hr>
                    leisure and education? From learning new words to maintaining your mental health, books can do it
                    all! In case you
                    needed a reminder of how important regular reading is for our wellbeing and literacy, here are the
                    top 10 benefits of
                    reading for all ages:<br>
                    <hr>

                    While reading, we have to remember different characters and settings that belong to a given story.
                    Even if you enjoy
                    reading a book in one sitting, you have to remember the details throughout the time you take to
                    read<br>
                    the book.
                    Therefore, reading is a workout for your brain that improves memory function.

                    <hr>
                    Did you know that most of the popular TV shows and movies are based on books? So why not indulge
                    in<br>
                    the original form of
                    entertainment by immersing yourself in reading. Most importantly, it’s free with your Markham Public
                    Library card.<br>
                    <hr>

                    <br>
                    We can all agree that reading cannot happen without focus and in order to fully understand the
                    story, we have to
                    concentrate on each page that we read. In a world where gadgets are only getting faster and<br>
                    shortening our attention
                    span, we need to constantly practice concentration and focus. Reading is one of the few activities
                    that requires your
                    undivided attention, therefore, improving your ability to concentrate.
