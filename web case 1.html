                    A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically
                    composed of
                    many pages (made of
                    papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover. The technical<br>
                    term
                    for this physical
                    arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for
                    extended
                    written compositions
                    or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf
                    and
                    each side of a leaf
                    is a page.
                    <br>
                    As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it
                    takes
                    a considerable
                    investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read. In a
                    restricted
                    sense, a book is a
                    self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage reflecting that, in antiquity,
                    long
                    works had to be<br>
                    written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. Each
                    part
                    of Aristotle's
                    Physics is called a book. In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which
                    such
                    sections, whether
                    called books or chapters or parts, are parts.
                    <br>
                    The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a<br>
                    book.
                    Books can consist only
                    of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. In a physical book,
                    the
                    pages can be left
                    blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, such as in an account book, an
                    appointment book, an
                    autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a sketchbook. Some physical books are made with pages
                    thick
                    and sturdy enough to
                    support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be distributed
                    in
                    electronic form as
                    ebooks and other formats.

                    Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic
                    work,
                    rather than a
                    reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science monograph denotes more
                    broadly any non-serial
                    publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like
                    Proust's
                    seven-volume In
                    Search of Lost Time), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal or newspaper.
                    An<br>
                    avid reader or
                    collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, "bookworm". A place where books are traded
                    is a
                    bookshop or
                    bookstore. Books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from libraries. Google has
                    estimated
                    that by 2010,
                    approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published.In some wealthier nations, the sale of
                    printed books has
                    decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks<br>
                    A codex (in modern usage) is the first information repository that modern people would recognize as
                    a "book": leaves of
                    uniform size bound in some manner along one edge, and typically held between two covers made of some
                    more robust
                    material. The first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from Martial, in his
                    Apophoreta CLXXXIV at the end
                    of the first century, where he praises its compactness. However, the codex never gained much
                    popularity in the pagan
                    Hellenistic world, and only within the Christian community did it gain widespread use.[12] This<br>
                    change happened
                    gradually during the 3rd and 4th centuries, and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book
                    are several: the
                    format is more economical, as both sides of the writing material can be used; and it is portable,
                    searchable, and easy
                    to conceal. A book is much easier to read, to find a page that you want, and to flip through. A
                    scroll is more awkward
                    to use. The Christian authors may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan
                    and<br>
                    Judaic texts written
                    on scrolls. In addition, some metal books were made, that required smaller pages of metal, instead
                    of an impossibly
                    long, unbending scroll of metal. A book can also be easily stored in more compact places, or side by
                    side in a tight
                    library or shelf space.<br>
                    The fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD saw the decline of the culture of ancient Rome.
                    Papyrus became
                    difficult to obtain due to lack of contact with Egypt, and parchment, which had been used for
                    centuries, became the main
                    writing material. Parchment is a material made from processed animal skin and used—mainly in the
                    past—for writing on.
                    Parchment is most commonly made of calfskin, sheepskin, or goatskin. It was historically used <br>
                    writing documents,
                    notes, or the pages of a book. Parchment is limed, scraped and dried under tension. It is not
                    tanned, and is thus
                    different from leather. This makes it more suitable for writing on, but leaves it very reactive to
                    changes in relative
                    humidity and makes it revert to rawhide if overly wet.
                    <br>
                    Monasteries carried on the Latin writing tradition in the Western Roman Empire. Cassiodorus, in the
                    monastery of
                    Vivarium (established around 540), stressed the importance of copying texts.[13] St. Benedict of
                    Nursia, in his Rule of
                    Saint Benedict (completed around the middle of the 6th century) later also promoted reading.[14] The
                    Rule of Saint
                    Benedict (Ch. XLVIII), which set aside certain times for reading, greatly influenced the monastic
                    culture of the Middle
                    Ages and is one of the reasons why the clergy were the predominant readers of books. The tradition
                    and style of the
                    Roman Empire still dominated, but slowly the peculiar medieval book culture emerged.<br>


                    The Codex Amiatinus anachronistically depicts the Biblical Ezra with the kind of books used in the
                    8th Century AD.
                    Before the invention and adoption of the printing press, almost all books were copied by hand, which
                    made books
                    expensive and comparatively rare. Smaller monasteries usually had only a few dozen books,
                    medium-sized perhaps a few
                    hundred. By the 9th century, larger collections held around 500 volumes and even at the end of
                    the<br>
                    Middle Ages, the
                    papal library in Avignon and Paris library of the Sorbonne held only around 2,000 volumes.

                    The scriptorium of the monastery was usually located over the chapter house. Artificial light was
                    forbidden for fear it<br>
                    may damage the manuscripts. There were five types of scribes:

                    Calligraphers, who dealt in fine book production
                    Copyists, who dealt with basic production and correspondence
                    Correctors, who collated and compared a finished book with the manuscript from which it had been
                    produced
                    Illuminators, who painted illustrations
                    Rubricators, who painted in the red letters

                    reading for all ages:<br>
                    <hr>

                    While reading, we have to remember different characters and settings that belong to a given story.
                    Even if you enjoy
                    reading a book in one sitting, you have to remember the details throughout the time you take to
                    read<br>
                    the book.
                    Therefore, reading is a workout for your brain that improves memory function.

                    Did you know that most of the popular TV shows and movies are based on books? So why not indulge
                    in<br>
                    the original form of
                    entertainment by immersing yourself in reading. Most importantly, it’s free with your Markham Public

                    <br>
                    We can all agree that reading cannot happen without focus and in order to fully understand the
                    story, we have to
                    concentrate on each page that we read. In a world where gadgets are only getting faster and<br>
                    shortening our attention
                    span, we need to constantly practice concentration and focus. Reading is one of the few activities
                    that requires your
                    undivided attention, therefore, improving your ability to concentrate.
