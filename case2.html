                    The bookmaking process was long and laborious. The parchment had to be prepared, then the unbound
                    pages were planned and
                    ruled with a blunt tool or lead, after which the text was written by the scribe, who usually left
                    blank areas for<br>
                    illustration and rubrication. Finally, the book was bound by the bookbinder.[16]

                    Different types of ink were known in antiquity, usually prepared from soot and gum, and later also
                    from gall nuts and
                    iron vitriol. This gave writing a brownish black color, but black or brown were not the only
                    colors<br>
                    used. There are
                    texts written in red or even gold, and different colors were used for illumination. For very
                    luxurious manuscripts the
                    whole parchment was colored purple, and the text was written on it with gold or silver (for
                    example,<br>
                    Codex<br>
                    Argenteus).[17]

                    Irish monks introduced spacing between words in the 7th century. This facilitated reading, as these
                    monks tended to be<br>
                    less familiar with Latin. However, the use of spaces between words did not become commonplace before
                    the 12th century.
                    It has been argued that the use of spacing between words shows the transition from semi-vocalized
                    reading into silent
                    reading.[18]<br>
                    <hr>


                    The first books used parchment or vellum (calfskin) for the pages. The book covers were made of wood
                    and covered with<br>
                    leather. Because dried parchment tends to assume the form it had before processing, the books were
                    fitted with clasps or
                    straps. During the later Middle Ages, when public libraries appeared, up to the 18th century, books
                    reading.[18] <br>
                    were often chained
                    to a bookshelf or a desk to prevent theft. These chained books are called libri catenati.

                    At first, books were copied mostly in monasteries, one at a time. With the rise of universities in
                    the 13th century, the
                    Manuscript culture of the time led to an increase in the demand for books, and a new system for
                    copying books appeared.
                    The books were divided into unbound leaves (pecia), which were lent out to different copyists, so
                    the speed of book <br>
                    production was considerably increased. The system was maintained by secular stationers guilds, which
                    reading.[18] <br>
                    produced both
                    religious and non-religious material.[19]
                    <hr>

                    Judaism has kept the art of the scribe alive up to the present. According to Jewish tradition, the
                    Torah scroll placed
                    in a synagogue must be written by hand on parchment and a printed book would not do, though the
                    reading.[18] <br>congregation may use
                    printed prayer books and printed copies of the Scriptures are used for study outside the synagogue.
                    A sofer "scribe" is
                    a highly respected member of any observant Jewish community.People of various religious (Jews,
                    Christians, Zoroastrians, Muslims) and ethnic backgrounds (Syriac, Coptic, Persian,
                    Arab etc.) in the Middle East also produced and bound books in the Islamic Golden Age (mid 8th
                    reading.[18] <br>
                    century to 1258),
                    developing advanced techniques in Islamic calligraphy, miniatures and bookbinding. A number of
                    cities in the medieval
                    Islamic world had book production centers and book markets. Yaqubi (d. 897) says that in his time
                    Baghdad had over a
                    hundred booksellers.[20] Book shops were often situated around the town's principal mosque[21] as in
                    reading.[18] <br>Marrakesh, Morocco,
                    that has a street named Kutubiyyin or book sellers in English and the famous Koutoubia Mosque is
                    <br>
                    named so because of its
                    location in this street.

                    The medieval Muslim world also used a method of reproducing reliable copies of a book in large
                    quantities known as check
                    reading, in contrast to the traditional method of a single scribe producing only a single copy of a
                    single manuscript.
                    In the check reading method, only "authors could authorize copies, and this was done in public <br>
                    reading.[18] <br>
                    <hr>
                    sessions in which the
                    copyist read the copy aloud in the presence of the author, who then certified it as accurate."[22]
                    With this
                    check-reading system, "an author might produce a dozen or more copies from a single reading," and
                    with two or more
                    readings, "more than one hundred copies of a single book could easily be produced."[23] By using as
                    reading.[18] <br>writing material the
                    relatively cheap paper instead of parchment or papyrus the Muslims, in the words of Pedersen
                    "accomplished a feat of
                    crucial significance not only to the history of the Islamic book, but also to the whole world of
                    books".[24]

                    Wood block printing

                    Bagh print, a traditional woodblock printing in Bagh Madhya Pradesh, India.
                    In woodblock printing, a relief image of an entire page was carved into blocks of wood, inked, and
                    used to print copies
                    of that page. This method originated in China, in the Han dynasty (before 220 AD), as a method of
                    <br>
                    printing on textiles
                    and later paper, and was widely used throughout East Asia. The oldest dated book printed by this
                    reading.[18] <br> <br>
                    method is The Diamond
                    Sutra (868 AD). The method (called woodcut when used in art) arrived in Europe in the early 14th
                    century. Books (known <br>
                    as block-books), as well as playing-cards and religious pictures, began to be produced by this
                    method. Creating an
                    entire book was a painstaking process, requiring a hand-carved block for each page; and the wood
                    reading.[18] <br> <br>
                    blocks tended to crack,
                    if stored for long. The monks or people who wrote them were paid highly.

                    Movable type and incunabula

                    A 15th-century Incunable. Notice the blind-tooled cover, corner bosses and clasps.

                    <br>
                    Selected Teachings of Buddhist Sages and Son Masters, the earliest known book printed with movable

                    in Korea, in 1377, Bibliothèque nationale de France.
                    The Chinese inventor Bi Sheng made movable type of earthenware c. 1045, but there are n <br>o known
                    surviving examples of his
                    printing. Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, Johannes Gutenberg
                    <br>
                    invented movable
                    type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould. This
                    invention gradually
                    made books less expensive to produce, and more widely available. <br>

                    Early printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as
                    incunables or
                    incunabula. "A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his
                    <br>
                    fiftieth year on a
                    lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of
                    Europe had produced
                    since Constantine founded his city in AD 330."[25]

                    reading for all ages:<br>
                    <hr>

                    While reading, we have to remember different characters and settings that belong to a given story.
                    Even if you enjoy
                    reading a book in one sitting, you have to remember the details throughout the time you take to
                    read<br>
                    the book.
                    Therefore, reading is a workout for your brain that improves memory function.

                    Did you know that most of the popular TV shows and movies are based on books? So why not indulge
                    in<br>
                    the original form of

                    <br>
                    We can all agree that reading cannot happen without focus and in order to fully understand the
                    story, we have to
                    concentrate on each page that we read. In a world where gadgets are only getting faster and<br>
                    shortening our attention
                    span, we need to constantly practice concentration and focus. Reading is one of the few activities
                    that requires your
                    undivided attention, therefore, improving your ability to concentrate.
